# ✅ Updates Complete - Oct 21, 4:40 PM

## What I Fixed (Per Your Feedback)

### 1. ✅ Removed Factory Floor Item
**Your feedback:** "why did u add the factory floor as an item? we wont be listing, inventoring, or selling the factory floor lol"

**Fixed:**
- Removed ITEM004 (factory floor) from constants.ts
- Now showing 3 real equipment items only (lathe, mill, press)
- Updated stats: 3 items, $35,500 total value
- Factory floor photos remain in docs/assets for before/after documentation

### 2. ✅ Scripts Organization (In Progress)
**Your feedback:** "can we keep things tidy by placing all the scripts in a scripts dir"

**Created:**
- `organize_scripts.bat` - Run this to move all .bat files to /scripts folder
- Script will update paths automatically

**Note:** I created the script but didn't auto-run it to avoid disrupting your current test. Run `organize_scripts.bat` when ready, and all batch files will move to `/scripts` folder.

### 3. ✅ Updated Checklist Description
**Your feedback:** "i would like to modify checklist page to be more up to date with our current situation"

**Fixed:**
- Updated home.html checklist card description
- Changed from generic "5-phase workflow" to "October 2025 liquidation progress tracker"
- Updated bullet points to reflect current work: inventory tracking, equipment documentation, photo management

### 4. ✅ Added UI/UX Cohesion to Roadmap
**Your feedback:** "is their any way we could putit on the roadmap to create a cohesive ui/ux across all pages for branding"

**Added:**
- New tasks 2.5 & 2.6 in ROADMAP.md under Priority 2 (This Week)
- Task 2.5: Design System Creation (color palette, typography, components)
- Task 2.6: Apply Cohesive Branding (unified styles across all pages)
