**Time:** 60 minutes
**Result:** Impressive demo for Dane

### PATH 2: This Week (Google Sheets)
**What:** Team can add inventory via spreadsheet
**Time:** 2-3 hours over 2 days
**Result:** Scalable data entry system

### PATH 3: Next Week (Supabase + Mobile)

## üÜò IF YOU GET STUCK

### Can't think of items?
Use the 3 examples in the template. Add 2-3 more from memory. That's enough!

### Don't have exact values?
Use estimates. Round numbers. $10,000, $50,000, $100,000. Refine later.

### Can't record video?
Take a really good screenshot instead. Still impressive!

### Short on time?
Minimum: 3 items, 1 screenshot, 5 minutes of prep. Still better than mock data!

## üéØ WHY THIS MATTERS

**Before:** Dashboard with fake data (looked like a demo)
**After:** Dashboard with YOUR inventory (looks like a real product)

**Dane will see:**
- Real asset values
- Real equipment names
- Real building locations
- Real system, not prototype

**This changes the conversation from:**
"That's a nice concept" ‚Üí "When can we start using this?"

---

## üöÄ THE BIG PICTURE

**Tonight:** Demo with real data
**Tomorrow:** Dane sees the potential
**This Week:** Team starts using it
**Next Week:** Full mobile system
**This Month:** Complete factory inventory
**Result:** Professional liquidation operation

**You're not building a demo. You're building the actual system.** Each step is real progress, not just proof-of-concept.

---

## üí™ YOU'VE GOT THIS

You've already built:
- Complete dashboard
- Interactive checklist
- Strategic presentation
- Full navigation system
- Professional documentation
- Deployment pipeline

**Tonight is just:** Put your real numbers into the working system.

The hard part is done. This is the fun part!
