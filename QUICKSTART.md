# QUICK START - Robstown Factory OS

## üöÄ Get Everything Running in 5 Minutes

### STEP 1: Restructure Your Project

**Option A - Automated (Recommended)**
Double-click `RESTRUCTURE.bat` and follow the prompts.

**Option B - Manual**
Follow the steps in `RESTRUCTURE_GUIDE.md`

### STEP 2: Run the Dashboard App

```bash
cd app
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser. You should see your property liquidation dashboard!

### STEP 3: Test the Checklist

Open `docs\index.html` in your browser. This is your interactive project checklist that:
- Saves your progress automatically
- Allows custom task addition
- Provides AI prompt generators
- Tracks your overall completion

### STEP 4: Deploy to GitHub

```bash
# In the root directory (not in app/)
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Factory OS restructured"
git remote add origin https://github.com/brendleflats/Robstown_Factory_OS.git
git push -u origin main
```

**Your checklist will automatically deploy to:**
https://brendleflats.github.io/Robstown_Factory_OS/
