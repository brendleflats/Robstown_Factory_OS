# ðŸŽ¯ TONIGHT'S ACTION PLAN - Real Inventory Demo

**Mission:** 30-second demo video showing dashboard with YOUR real inventory

**Time Needed:** 60-90 minutes

---

## âœ… YOUR EXACT STEPS

### STEP 1: Gather Real Inventory (15 minutes)

**Open:** `inventory-template.json`

**Fill in 5-10 items** from your factory. For each item, provide:
- Item name (be specific)
- Building (1, 2, or 3)
- Condition (Excellent, Good, Fair, or Poor)
- Estimated value (dollars)
- Brief description
- Location within building

**Example format is already in the file** - just replace the placeholder items with your real ones.

**Pro tip:** Start with your highest-value or most impressive items.

---

### STEP 2: Convert Data (2 minutes)

**Run:** Double-click `update-inventory.bat`

This will:
1. Read your inventory-template.json
2. Convert it to dashboard format
3. Update app/constants.ts
4. Start the dashboard
5. Open browser automatically

**If it fails:** Check that your JSON is valid (no syntax errors).

---

### STEP 3: Verify Dashboard (5 minutes)

Dashboard should auto-open at http://localhost:5173

**Check these things:**
- [ ] Your real items are displayed
- [ ] Total value matches your estimates
- [ ] Building colors are correct
- [ ] You can click buildings to filter
- [ ] You can click items to see details
- [ ] Everything looks good

**If something's wrong:** Edit inventory-template.json and run update-inventory.bat again.

---

### STEP 4: Record Demo Video (30 minutes)

**Choose your recording method:**
- **Loom** (easiest): https://www.loom.com
- **Windows Game Bar** (built-in): Press Windows + G
- **OBS Studio** (best quality): https://obsproject.com

**Follow the script in DEMO_VIDEO_GUIDE.md:**
1. Show dashboard overview (10s)
2. Click building to filter (10s)
3. Click item to show details (10s)

**Tips:**
- Keep it under 30 seconds
- Speak clearly and confidently
- If you mess up, just record again
- Usually takes 2-3 attempts to get a good one

**Detailed instructions:** See `DEMO_VIDEO_GUIDE.md`

### STEP 5: Add to Presentation (10 minutes)

**Option A: Embed video in Slide 5**
1. Open your presentation file
2. Go to Slide 5 (Dashboard slide)
3. Insert â†’ Video â†’ Upload video
4. Position it where the screenshot currently is
5. Set to auto-play

**Option B: Replace with new screenshot**
1. Take screenshot of dashboard with real data
2. Replace factory-os-preview.png
3. Keep video separate for sharing

**Option C: Create new slide**
1. Add new slide after Slide 5
2. Title: "Live Demo - Real Inventory"
3. Embed video
4. Add caption: "Watch the dashboard in action"

---

### STEP 6: Push to GitHub (5 minutes)

```bash
# Run this to update everything:
git add .
git commit -m "Added real inventory data and demo video"
git push
```

Or just double-click `final_commit.bat`

## ðŸ’¡ IF YOU'RE SHORT ON TIME TONIGHT

**Minimum Viable Demo (30 minutes):**
1. Fill in just 3 items in inventory-template.json
2. Run update-inventory.bat
3. Open dashboard, take screenshot
4. Use screenshot instead of video
5. Done!

**You can always:**
- Record video tomorrow morning
- Add more items later
- Create full demo next week

**The key is:** Show Dane something REAL tonight/tomorrow, even if it's minimal.

## ðŸ†˜ TROUBLESHOOTING

### "node is not recognized"
Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/

### "npm run dev fails"
```bash
cd app
rm -rf node_modules
rm package-lock.json
npm install
npm run dev
```

### "Invalid JSON in inventory-template"
Use https://jsonlint.com/ to validate your JSON.
