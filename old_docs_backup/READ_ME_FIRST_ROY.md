## 🎯 NEW FEATURE: Review Status!

Items you add get marked "Pending Review":
- You add them via AI
- Dane/John review them
- They approve or reject
- Approved → "For Sale"
- Rejected → "Scrap"

**Why?** So everything gets approval before being listed.

1. Double-click `export-for-review.bat`
2. Opens CSV spreadsheet
3. Email to Dane or share screen
4. He types "YES" or "NO" in APPROVE column
