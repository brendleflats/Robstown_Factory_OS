## üì∏ What You Still Need from Your Phone

To make the **7-minute demo perfect for Dane**, capture these on your phone:

### **Priority 1: Inventory App Screenshots** (3 needed)
Already identified in `Factory/` folder - these are DONE! ‚úÖ
- `Screenshot_20251019-174240.Chrome.png` (AI Analysis)
- `Screenshot_20251019-154856.Chrome.png` (Value Estimate)
- `Screenshot_20251019-154901.Chrome.png` (Saved Items)

### **Priority 2: Video Demo** (30 seconds)
üìπ **Record this workflow on your phone**:
1. Open the inventory app
2. Take a photo of an item (5 sec)
3. Tap "Analyze" and wait for AI (8 sec)
4. Select Condition & Disposition (5 sec)
5. Add a note (5 sec)
6. Tap "Save Item" (2 sec)
7. Show success message (5 sec)

**Save as**: `inventory-demo-30sec.mp4`

### **Priority 3: More Site Photos** (Optional - for next iteration)
- Wide shots of cleared floor space
- "Before/After" comparison shots
- Team working photos
- Close-ups of high-value items

---

## üêõ Known Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: React Dashboard Constants Error
**Error**: `The requested module '/constants.ts' does not provide an export named 'STATUS_COLORS'`

**Status**: Low priority - Dashboard is WIP, doesn't affect presentation or checklist

**Fix** (when needed):
```typescript
// In app/components/InventoryModal.tsx, line 5
// Change this:
import { STATUS_COLORS } from '/constants.ts';

// To this:
import { STATUS_COLORS } from '../constants';
```

### Issue 2: Tailwind CDN Warning
**Warning**: `cdn.tailwindcss.com should not be used in production`

**Status**: Non-critical - Site works perfectly, just not "best practice"

**Fix** (future optimization):
Install Tailwind properly via npm when building dashboard
