## What Happens After You Upload Photos

### Immediate Actions (I'll handle these):
1. **Fix the constants.ts error** preventing inventory saves
2. **Create demo video slideshow** using your app screenshots
3. **Populate dashboard** with real inventory data from your item photos
4. **Update home.html** to be the unified landing page
5. **Clean up repository** - remove redundant MD files
6. **Create inspection checklist** for Dane (improved version of your draft)

### The New Structure (Simplified):
```
Robstown_Factory_OS/
├── app/                    ← React app (AI inventory tool)
├── docs/                   ← GitHub Pages site

## Your 30-Second Demo Video Script

Once you have the screenshots, I'll create this flow:

1. **Scene 1** (5 sec): "Robstown Factory Inventory System"
2. **Scene 2** (5 sec): Open app → Camera view with item
3. **Scene 3** (10 sec): AI analyzes → Auto-fills fields → You add condition
4. **Scene 4** (5 sec): Save → Item appears in dashboard
5. **Scene 5** (5 sec): "Real-time liquidation tracking. Built by Roy Hodge."
