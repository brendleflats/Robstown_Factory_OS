## If You Need GitHub Authentication

If the push fails asking for credentials, you'll need a Personal Access Token.

### Creating a Personal Access Token (2 minutes)

1. **Go to GitHub Settings**
   - Visit: https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Or: GitHub.com ‚Üí Your Profile (top right) ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Developer settings ‚Üí Personal access tokens ‚Üí Tokens (classic)

2. **Generate New Token**
   - Click "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Give it a note: "Factory OS Deployment"
   - Select scopes: Check **repo** (this gives full control of private repositories)
   - Set expiration: 90 days (or longer if you prefer)
   - Click "Generate token"

3. **COPY THE TOKEN** 
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è You can only see it once! Copy it now!
   - It looks like: `ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

4. **Use Token Instead of Password**
   - Username: `brendleflats` (your GitHub username)
   - Password: Paste your token (not your actual password!)

## If Repository Already Exists

If you get an error about the repository already existing, you have two options:

### Option 1: Force Push (Replaces Everything)
```bash
git push -u origin main --force
```

### Option 2: Pull First, Then Push
```bash
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
git push -u origin main
```

## Enable GitHub Pages (After Successful Push)

1. Visit: https://github.com/brendleflats/Robstown_Factory_OS
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Click **Pages** in left sidebar
4. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**
5. Wait 2-3 minutes
6. Your checklist will be live at: https://brendleflats.github.io/Robstown_Factory_OS/

## Troubleshooting

### "fatal: not a git repository"

The repo has content you don't have locally. Options:
1. Force push: `git push -u origin main --force`
2. Or pull first: `git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories`

### "Authentication failed"
Use Personal Access Token instead of password (see above)

### "remote: Repository not found"
- Check the repo exists: https://github.com/brendleflats/Robstown_Factory_OS
- Make sure you have access to it
- Verify the remote URL: `git remote -v`

### GitHub Pages shows 404
- Wait 2-3 minutes (it takes time to deploy)

- Check Actions tab for any errors
