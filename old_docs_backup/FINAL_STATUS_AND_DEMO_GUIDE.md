## ðŸ“¸ Content Checklist (What You Still Need)

Based on Gemini's analysis, you have everything except:

### **Missing (Optional Enhancements):**
1. **Inventory Demo Video** (30 seconds)
   - Film: Open app â†’ Take photo â†’ AI analyzes â†’ Add condition/disposition â†’ Save
   - This would go in the presentation as a video slide
   - **Status:** VID_20251019_171316903.mp4 exists but needs verification

2. **Additional Hero Items** (Optional)
   - You have 3 hero items, Gemini suggested 5
   - **Status:** Not critical - we have the transformer which is perfect
