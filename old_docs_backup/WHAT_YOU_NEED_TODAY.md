## üîß What I'm Fixing While You Charge Your Phone

### Fix 1: Import Error
**Problem**: `constants.ts` export cache issue  
**Solution**: Clear build cache, rebuild app  
**Status**: Ready to test once you provide photos

**Solution**: Consolidate into clear hierarchy  
**Files to Remove**:
- `AI_WORKFLOW_SIMPLE.md`
- `ALL_FIXES_APPLIED.md`
- `DASHBOARD_FIXED.md`
- `FIXED_AND_READY.md`
- `READ_ME_FIRST_ROY.md`
- `READ_THIS_FIRST_ROY.md`
- `START_HERE.md`
- `START_HERE_TODAY.md`
- `START_INVENTORY_DEMO.md`
- `TODAY_CHECKLIST.md`
- `TODAY_SIMPLE_PLAN.md`
- `TONIGHT_ACTION_PLAN.md`

**Files to Keep**:
- `README.md` - Main project overview
- `QUICKSTART.md` - Quick reference
- `COMPREHENSIVE_ACTION_PLAN.md` - Today's master plan
- `TODAYS_PHOTO_CHECKLIST.md` - Photo gathering guide
- `WHAT_YOU_NEED_TODAY.md` - This file!

### Fix 3: Update README
**Current**: Good structure, minor tweaks needed  
**Changes**: Update demo links, add inspection guide

## üìä Inventory Data Workflow (New & Improved)

### Current System (Manual):
1. Take photo with app
2. AI analyzes ‚Üí fills fields  
3. You add condition/disposition
4. Save ‚Üí localStorage only
5. **Problem**: Not shared, not exportable

### New System (Starting Today):
1. Same photo/AI workflow
2. Save ‚Üí generates JSON entry
3. Export to CSV button
4. Upload CSV to shared folder
5. Dane/John review and approve
6. Approved items ‚Üí marked "For Sale"
7. **Result**: Shared, reviewable, professional

### I'll Add Export Feature:
```javascript
// New button in dashboard:
"Export Inventory to CSV"

// Downloads file named:
inventory-2025-01-19.csv

// Contains columns:
ID, Name, Value, Condition, Disposition, Review Status, Notes
```
