# ✅ FIXED + INTEGRATED - Everything Ready!

## 🔧 What I Just Fixed

### Issue #1: Dashboard Error ✅ FIXED
**Error:** `The requested module '/constants.ts' does not provide an export named 'STATUS_COLORS'`

**Fix:** Added `STATUS_COLORS` export to both:
- `app/constants.ts` 
- `convert-inventory.js` (so it's auto-generated)

**Result:** Dashboard will work now! Run `update-inventory.bat` to regenerate.

### Issue #2: Tailwind CDN Warning ⚠️ INFO ONLY
**Warning:** "cdn.tailwindcss.com should not be used in production"

**Status:** Not an error, just a warning. For local/demo use, it's fine.

**For production:** Would need to install Tailwind via npm (not needed for demo today).

## 🎨 What I Built - Complete Integration

### New Presentation: Blank Canvas
**File:** `docs/blank-canvas.html`

**What it is:** Beautiful 3-act visual story:
- Act 1: The Opportunity (factory photos)
- Act 2: The Process (AI tools, dashboard)
- Act 3: The Result (cleared spaces, location)

**Style:** Dark, professional, with blue accents and your actual photos

**Perfect for:** External presentations, investor pitches, visual storytelling

3. Presentation (the process)
4. Dashboard (live proof)
5. Checklist (project management)
