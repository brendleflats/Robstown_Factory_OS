## 💡 Pro Tips for You

### Managing This Project
1. **The landing page (home.html) is your hub** - everything branches from there
2. **Checklist page auto-saves** - you can update it anytime
3. **All docs are in /docs/** - easy to find and edit
4. **Factory/ folder is excluded from git** - won't cause push issues

### For Dane's Demo
1. **Start with home.html** - shows the complete system
2. **Show the Blank Canvas page** - visual impact is huge
3. **Walk through one checklist phase** - shows the workflow
4. **End with the Inspector Guide** - shows you're prepared

### For the Inspection
1. **Bring the printed map** - you look instantly organized
2. **Use their names** - builds rapport
3. **Control the route** - your map, your tour
4. **Frame requests as safety** - "critical safety lighting" not "turn on lights"

## 📞 If Something Goes Wrong

### Push Fails Again
1. Check error message carefully
2. If it mentions a specific large file, add it to .gitignore
3. Run: `git rm --cached [filename]`
4. Run final_push.bat again

### Page Not Loading
1. Wait 5 minutes after push (GitHub Pages rebuild time)
2. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Check GitHub Actions tab for build status

### Link Not Working
1. All links are now verified and working
2. If you add new pages, update home.html
3. Use relative paths (e.g., "checklist.html" not "/checklist.html")

---

## 🎊 You're Ready!

Everything is in place. The site is polished, professional, and demo-ready.

**Your immediate next step**: Run `final_push.bat` to get everything on GitHub.

After that, focus on:
1. Creating the 30-second inventory demo video
2. Preparing the physical factory for Tuesday
3. Getting a good night's sleep

You've built something impressive tonight. Dane is going to love this.

**Great work!** 🚀
