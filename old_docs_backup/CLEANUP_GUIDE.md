# 🧹 CLEANUP & STREAMLINE GUIDE

This document identifies files you can safely delete to keep your repository lean and focused.

---

## ✅ ESSENTIAL FILES (KEEP THESE)

### Core Application
- `app/` folder (entire React application)
- `docs/` folder (entire GitHub Pages site)
- `.git/` folder (version control - never touch)
- `.gitignore` (tells git what to ignore)
- `README_NEW.md` (current documentation)

### Useful Guides
- `MASTER_ACTION_PLAN.md` ⭐ Your complete roadmap
- `STATUS_REPORT.md` ⭐ Current status & next steps
- `PHOTO_CHECKLIST_SIMPLE.md` ⭐ Photo download guide
- `QUICKSTART.md` (Quick reference)

### Deployment Tools
- `commit_fixes.bat` ⭐ One-click commit & push
- `quick_commit.bat` (alternative commit tool)

### Data Files
- `inventory-template.json` (inventory data structure)
- `factory-os-preview.png` (dashboard screenshot)

## 🚀 HOW TO CLEAN UP

### Option 1: Manual Deletion (Safest)
1. Review the list above
2. Right-click each file → Delete
3. Move to Recycle Bin (not permanent yet)
4. Test that everything still works
5. Empty Recycle Bin if all is well

### Option 2: Batch Script (Faster)
I can create a cleanup script that moves all unnecessary files to a `_archive` folder.
This way, you can review them before permanently deleting.

Want me to create that script?

## 📊 BEFORE & AFTER

### Before Cleanup:
- 60+ files in root directory
- Multiple duplicate READMEs
- Confusing where to start
- Hard to navigate

### After Cleanup:
- ~15 essential files in root
- Clear purpose for each file
- Easy to find what you need
- Professional structure

---

## ✅ YOUR STREAMLINED STRUCTURE

After cleanup, your root will look like this:

```
Factory_OS/
├── app/                              # React app
├── docs/                             # GitHub Pages
├── .git/                             # Version control
├── .gitignore                        # Git ignore rules
│
├── README_NEW.md                     ← Main documentation
├── QUICKSTART.md                     ← Quick reference
├── MASTER_ACTION_PLAN.md             ← Your complete roadmap
├── STATUS_REPORT.md                  ← Current status
├── PHOTO_CHECKLIST_SIMPLE.md         ← Photo guide
│
├── inventory-template.json           ← Data structure
├── factory-os-preview.png            ← Dashboard image
│
├── commit_fixes.bat                  ← Deployment tool
└── quick_commit.bat                  ← Alternative commit
```

Clean. Focused. Professional.

## 💡 RECOMMENDATION

**Wait until after your Dane demo to delete files.**

Reason: You might need to reference something quickly. After the demo is successful and everything is committed to GitHub, then do the cleanup.
