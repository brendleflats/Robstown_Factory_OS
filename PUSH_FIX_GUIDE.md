# üöÄ PUSH FIX GUIDE

## The Problem
You're trying to push 470MB+ of photos/videos from the Factory directory. GitHub rejects pushes over ~100MB for individual files and struggles with large total sizes.

## The Solution (Choose One)

### Option 1: ULTIMATE_PUSH_FIX.BAT (Recommended)
**What it does:** Removes all Factory files from git tracking (they stay on your computer), then pushes cleanly.

**Run this:**
```
ultimate_push_fix.bat
```

**Result:** Your code and documentation push successfully. Factory files remain local-only.

---

### Option 2: Manual Git LFS Setup (If you need Factory files on GitHub)
If you absolutely need the Factory media files on GitHub, use Git Large File Storage:

```batch
REM Install Git LFS first: https://git-lfs.github.com/
git lfs install
git lfs track "Factory/*.jpg"
git lfs track "Factory/*.png"
git lfs track "Factory/*.mp4"
git add .gitattributes
git commit -m "Add Git LFS tracking for Factory media"
git push origin main
```

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ What's Working
- All HTML pages (home, dashboard, blank canvas, presentation)
- All documentation files
- App code in `/docs`
- `.gitignore` is properly configured

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What's Blocked
- Factory directory (470MB) is trying to push
- GitHub rejects large files without Git LFS

### üìÅ Your Local Files Are Safe
All your Factory photos are on your computer. The `.gitignore` will keep them local. You only need selected "hero" images for the web demo, and those should go in `docs/assets/`.

---

## Recommended Workflow

1. **Run `ultimate_push_fix.bat`** - This removes Factory from git and pushes everything else
2. **Curate 10-15 hero images** from Factory folder
3. **Copy them to `docs/assets/`** with descriptive names:
   - `hero-transformer.jpg`
   - `site-entrance.jpg`
   - `cleared-area-1.jpg`
   - etc.
4. **Update HTML pages** to reference the curated images
5. **Push again** - Only small, optimized images go to GitHub

---

## After You Run ultimate_push_fix.bat

Your Factory directory will:
- ‚úÖ Still exist on your computer
- ‚úÖ Be ignored by git (per `.gitignore`)
- ‚úÖ Not slow down or block future commits
- ‚úÖ Be available for you to select "hero" shots from

Your GitHub repo will:
- ‚úÖ Have all your code and docs
- ‚úÖ Load fast for Dane
- ‚úÖ Be professional and clean
- ‚úÖ Only show curated assets in `docs/assets/`

## Questions?

**Q: Will I lose my Factory photos?**
A: No! They stay on your computer. Only git stops tracking them.

**Q: How do I add specific photos later?**
A: Copy them to `docs/assets/` and commit. Git will track those.

**Q: Can I undo this?**
A: Yes, remove the Factory lines from `.gitignore` and re-add them.

**Next step: Run `ultimate_push_fix.bat` now.**
