## 🐛 KNOWN ISSUES (Non-Critical)

1. **Tailwind CDN Warning**: The console shows "cdn.tailwindcss.com should not be used in production"
   - **Impact**: None. It's just a warning.
   - **Fix**: Only needed if we productionize the full app (use PostCSS)

2. **Placeholder Images in Presentation**: Some slides still use placeholder images
   - **Impact**: Doesn't look as professional
   - **Fix**: Replace with real photos (covered in Step 3 above)

3. **No Real Inventory Data Yet**: Dashboard shows sample data
   - **Impact**: Can't demo live data updates
   - **Fix**: Add 3-5 real items using the app today
