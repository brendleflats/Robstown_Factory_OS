# 🌐 GITHUB PAGES SETUP - Step by Step

## 📋 Prerequisites
- ✅ Code pushed to GitHub (run `final_commit.bat` first)
- ✅ Repository exists at: https://github.com/brendleflats/Robstown_Factory_OS

---

## 🚀 Setup Steps (Takes 2 Minutes)

### Step 1: Go to Your Repository Settings
1. Open: https://github.com/brendleflats/Robstown_Factory_OS
2. Click the **⚙️ Settings** tab (top right, next to "Insights")

### Step 2: Navigate to Pages Section
1. In the left sidebar, scroll down
2. Click **"Pages"** (under "Code and automation" section)

### Step 3: Configure Source
You'll see "Build and deployment" section.

**Under "Source":**
- Click the dropdown (probably says "Deploy from a branch" or "None")
- Select: **GitHub Actions**

That's it! GitHub will now automatically deploy using your workflow.

### Step 4: Wait for Deployment (2-3 minutes)
1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your repo
2. You'll see a workflow running (yellow dot 🟡)
3. Wait for it to turn green (✓)
4. Once green, your site is live!

## ✅ Verify It's Working

### Check the Actions Tab
Visit: https://github.com/brendleflats/Robstown_Factory_OS/actions

You should see:
- "pages build and deployment" workflow
- Green checkmark when complete
- "Deploy Checklist (from /docs)" workflow

### Test Your Live URLs
After 2-3 minutes, these should work:

**Home Page:**
https://brendleflats.github.io/Robstown_Factory_OS/home.html

**Checklist (Default):**
https://brendleflats.github.io/Robstown_Factory_OS/

**Presentation:**
https://brendleflats.github.io/Robstown_Factory_OS/presentation.html

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If "Pages" Tab Doesn't Exist
Your repo might be private. Make it public:
1. Go to Settings → General
2. Scroll to bottom: "Danger Zone"
3. Click "Change visibility" → Make public

### If GitHub Actions Option Isn't Available
You need to enable Actions:
1. Settings → Actions → General
2. Under "Actions permissions"
3. Select "Allow all actions and reusable workflows"
4. Click Save

### If Deployment Fails
Check the Actions tab for error messages:
1. Click on the failed workflow
2. Click on the job that failed
3. Read the error message
4. Common fix: Make sure `.github/workflows/deploy-checklist.yml` exists

### If 404 Error on Pages
Wait 3-5 minutes. GitHub Pages can be slow on first deployment.

## 🎯 What Happens After Setup

### Every Time You Push:
1. GitHub detects changes
2. Workflow automatically runs
3. Deploys `/docs` folder to GitHub Pages
4. Updates live site in 2-3 minutes

### Your Workflow File:
Location: `.github/workflows/deploy-checklist.yml`

This file tells GitHub to:
- Deploy when you push to `main` branch
- Only upload the `/docs` folder
- Make it available at your GitHub Pages URL
